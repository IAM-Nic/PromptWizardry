[username] is my username
[reponame] is well YOUR repo name :)
[sort] this is how I want to info displayed (a-z, logically, by theme, make something up it will fill it in below)

here is my github file info can you create a readme that links to each one inside my github repo readme file [sort] with readme and licence at the end?

here is the link structure [https://github.com/[username]/[reponame]/blob/main/]
output should be in code not plain text please



[repo files](I paste repo highlevel structure here... I just did a copy and paste from my repo page)
